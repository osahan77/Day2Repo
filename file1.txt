First file
### The flow :

- Create a local repository
    - `.git` folder is created under the repo and that's where all the changes are tracked
    - Optionally : GitHub Desktop will create .gitAttiribute file  (you may ignore it for now)
- Add `file1.txt`
- Observe the change in GitHub Desktop app in `change` Tab ( `staging area` )
- Make a commit with proper commit message
- Observe it in the history
- repeat it couple times and observe the history
- Now we are ready to publish the local git repo into [GitHub.com](http://github.com)
- GitHub Desktop app make it easy by providing the `publish repository` (This is one time process)
- Observe the remote GitHub repository is created and all your files are there.
- Go back to your atom , make more changes and `commit` with proper commit message
- In GitHub Desktop , click `push origin` button, origin is the name that [Github.com](http://github.com) reserve for remote repo , for example :
    - if your local repo is `Day1` your remote repo when you push will be `origin/Day1`
